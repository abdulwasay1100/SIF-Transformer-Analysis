# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the quarto book of our project 'Transformer-Based Analysis of SIF Under Drought Conditions'. This project was developed as part of the university courses Spatio-temporal Data by Dr. Guido Kraemer and Scientific Writing by Prof. Dr. Miguel Mahecha. This book contains an introduction to our project with the documented code used for this analysis and our results. For more information on how this book was created, or how to install the Python environment, see our [GitLab repository](https://git.sc.uni-leipzig.de/ss2024-12-geo-m-ds02/sif_transformer).
