    "Our analysis reveals that air temperature, precipitation, and radiation are the most significant factors influencing SIF, aligning with the understanding that these variables directly impact photosynthetic activity.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, our model's predictions for extreme events such as drought, intense rainfall, and heatwaves present some inconsistencies with established ecological principles. While drought conditions (here simulated as a decrease of precipitation and soil moisture and an increase in temperature) typically limit photosynthetic activity due to water scarcity, our model predicts an increase in SIF. This suggests a potential misinterpretation of the interactions between precipitation, air temperature, and surface moisture. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing individual features, the model predicts the increase of SIF with rising air temperatures and higher transpiration rates. It shows limited sensitivity to changes in precipitation and radiation, and an unexpected negative response to increased surface moisture. These responses highlight the need for further refinement of the model to accurately capture the interplay of drought related variables affecting plant photosynthetic activity. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our transformer-based encoder model provides first insights into the importance of drought related variables influencing SIF but also shows the necessity for further improvement to better understand ecosystem response to extreme climatic events. <br>\n"
